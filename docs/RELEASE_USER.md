# Release Notes Digital Product Pass Application

User friendly relase notes without specific technical details.

**July 3 2024 (Version 4.0.0)**
*03.07.2024*

### Added

#### Digital Product Pass Verification Add-on Baekend Implementation

Digital Product Pass Verification Add-on Implementation is finally available at the digital product pass backend.
The backend was refactored to be constructure in a modular way. All the core components of the backend were moved into the 'core' module.
The 'verification' module includes all the functionality required to verify credentials using the simple wallet component.

#### Digital Product Pass Simple Wallet from DPP Verification Add-on Available

A functional wallet developed in Python is now available. It is a minimal viable wallet component that can be used to:

- Generate Valid JSON-LD `@context` schemas from existing SAMM Models standarized in Catena-X.
  - So that the data from the aspect models can be placed inside of the verifiable credentials.
- Issue a verifiable credential with data model v2 with a DID Web resolvable proof and JsonWebSignature2020
- Verify a verifiable credential with a DID Web resolvable proof from typy JsonWebKey2020
- Provide a standard did.json endpoint for a specific Bussiness Partner Number
- Manage the authorization by bpn and api keys
- Store an log of your signed verifiable credentials

#### Digital Product Pass Verification Add-on Schemas and Semantics Available

Now the semantic models for the Certified Data Credential and some examples are available under dpp-verification semantics.
Also its available the json-ld schemas for the digital product pass aspect model and the certified data credential under schemas.

#### Digital Product Pass Verification Add-on Frontend Implementation

Visualize if the credential you are retriving is verifiable or not. Be able to refresh the verification of the credential signature on the fly and be able to visualize the issuer, owner and wallet that handled the verification.

### Updated

#### Repository Refactored

The repository was refactored and prepared for the release R24.08 of Catena-X. Cleaning all the Consortia releated information in the documentation.

#### Issues Fixed in the Frontend

Several minor bugs that were affecting the stability of the application were fixed and the frontend code was refactored.

#### Digital Product Pass Verification Documentation Updated

The Digital Product Pass Verification Documentation was updated in order to match the latest updates done and specified during the implementation.
Now the documentation contains SAMM models, schemas, example payloads, details of the Implementation in the application, new structure, new diagrams, examples on how to link digital twins in type level, detailed explanations on why verification is necessary and the added value.

**August 15 2023 (Version 1.0.0)**
*15.08.2023*

### Added

#### Added EDC v0.5.0 version support

As of now, there is a possibility to run EDC `v0.5.0` version of consumer and provider connectors contained in `deployment/infrastructure/edc-provider` and `deployment/infrastructure/edc-consumer`. Additionally, the last EDC version `v0.4.1` is also compatible with the backend application.

#### Added Decentralized Digital Twin Registry integration

The backend component is upgraded to call the decentral Digital Twin Regitry using Asset Administration Shell (AAS) `v3.0` API syntax. Also, integrated the usage of the Discovery Finder service to retrieve the endpoints from the EDC Discovery and the BPN Discovery services.

#### Added search parameter

The search Id is now based on 3 parts separated by colon `CX:<manufacturerPartId>:<serializedId>` and followed by the `CX` prefix. The purpose is to search the asset through these parameters using a decentral registry approach. The manufacturer part Id and serialized Id are also validated.

#### Added persistent storage

The data preservation layer is implemented to ensure that the contract details are stored in logs in order to be complaint with Data Sovereignty requirements.

#### Added TRG requirements

The main following TRG requirements that were added were:

##### TRG-4.06 Added notice for docker images

The released container images need to be annotated to provide good quality images. This has to be defined in a dedicated Notice for docker image section and on the respective image page on DockerHub.

##### TRG-5.04 Added resource management

There needs to be the resource management configuration added along with the application settings. This enables the ability to utilize the CPU and memory consumption as best practices and to match minimum requirements when running an application.

##### TRG-1.02 Added instructions to install the application

There is getting started guide `INSTALL.md` included to the documentation to setup the application from the scratch.

### Updated

#### Updated the EDC v0.5.0 configuration

#### Updated documentation and prepared for release

Updated all the documentation in `docs` folder to match the latest version of the code.

### Security Improvements

#### Added user and file permissions

The user and file permissions are added in the container file system to run as a non-root user for the better security and to restrict the user from unnecessary access.

#### Validate the application against the foreign BPN number

The user authentication is checked against the specified BPN number, EDC consumer, the backend application in order to restrict access the application for security purposes.


**July 03 2023 (Pre-release 1.0.0-alpha)**
*03.07.2023*

### Added

#### Added legal notice in frontend UI
Now the user is able to see the legal notice inclusing the license, the notice and the Commit Id from the source repository.

#### Added legal files into the backend compiled JAR
When the images are generated, and the backend is compiled the LICENSE, NOTICE and DEPENCENCIES_BACKEND are moved inside the JAR file,
into the META-INF folder.

#### Added Official Container Images to Docker Hub
Now the container images are available publicly on the Docker Hub Registry Platform through automated workflows.
They are released in the following URLs:
  - https://hub.docker.com/r/tractusx/digital-product-pass-frontend
  - https://hub.docker.com/r/tractusx/digital-product-pass-backend


#### Integration from frontend and new asynchronous backend
The frontend is now making the negotiation with the backend component in a asynchronous way.

#### Made backend asynchronous.
By creating a asynchronous backend we are improving the control that the user  has over the contract negotiation.
Now the user can decline, cancel and sign the contract requests and visualize the status of the negotiation.
Now the backend  is also negotiating faster with the EDC `v0.4.1` so that is quicker and optimized

#### Added file system negotiation logs.
Each process stores in the container file system (non persistent) the contract negotiation files as well the information for the transfer process.

### Security Improvements

#### Added a new layer of security in the contract negotiation
Allow only the user to sign, decline or cancel the contract negotiation by using a session token generated uniquely in the backend and asigned to the user.
That means that only the user can access its own data. And the backend will make sure that everything is correct otherwise no action is taken.

#### Added cryptography to the passport transfer process
As defined in the documentation of the EDC the passport must be store in the backend until the user  requests for its retrieval.
We are now encrypting the passport  when it arrives from the EDC consumer data plane and we alse asure that the user  will be the only  one  that  can decrypt it. Once the user requests the  passport it is destroyed and no longer available.


### Updated

#### Updated EDC Provider and Consumer Versions to `v0.4.1`
Now the test EDC consusumer and provider contained in `deployment/infrastructure/edc-provider` and `deployment/infrastructure/edc-consumer` are updated to the latest version at the moment available the `v0.4.1` 


## Removed cx-backend-service support
The backend application fully substituted the cx-backend-service by unwrapping the token and storing the information encrypted (an improvement in comparation with the cx-backend-service)
The API that should be used is `/endpoint`


**June 20 2023 (Version 0.9.0)**
*20.06.2023*

### Added

#### Added new welcome screen with basic description of the application and new search bar with QR code.
Now the welcome screen has a description of the application and the search mechanism was improved.

### Updated

#### Optimized the responsiveness of the welcome screen and the search field and optimized UX to match the view of the passport.
Now is more intuitive to navigate through the welcome screen and access the search field.


### Security Issue
