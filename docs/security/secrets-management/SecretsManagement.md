## Secrets management with HashiCorp Vault Service

The client credentials, database passwords, access tokens are considered as secrets and they are usually kept in a vault. CatenaX have a central Hashicorp vault component to store these types of secrets and credentails to prevant from revealing them in a public source code repository to ensure security. These secrets are then utilized by Kubernetes resources through helm charts in a safe and secure manner.

At the time of writing this guide, ArgoCD was used to deploy the application. It accesses the secrets through its built-in vault plugins which solves the secret management issues with GitOps. Vault plugin internally uses a special vault token for authentication,  retrieve actual secret values against their keys and subsitute them in a deployment.

Further read about ArgoCD valut plugin here: [ArgoCD vault plugin](https://argocd-vault-plugin.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

MaterialPass team is allocated a vault space at [HashiCorp Vault - Material Pass ](https://vault.demo.catena-x.net/ui/vault/secrets/material-pass/list).

To access a material pass vault space, a vault token is required

 Vault contents:
- **edc/oauth#api.key** 
- **edc/participant#bpnNumber**
- **backend/#signKey**
- **backend#clientId**
- **backend#clientSecret**
- **oauth#realm**
- **oauth#appId**
- **oauth#xApiKey**

To put a secret from vault, a special pattern is followed in helm values files:

```bash
<path:some/path#secret-key#version>
```

Some examples below:
```bash
<path:material-pass/data/int/edc/vault#vault.hashicorp.url>
<path:material-pass/data/int/edc/vault#vault.hashicorp.url#1>
```

**Note:** ***/data/*** path is always be placed after ***material-pass***, though it is not defined in a vault directory structure. AVP uses this data path itself internally.

To use a vault and create new secret, please look here: [how to-use vault create a secret](https://catenax-ng.github.io/docs/guides/how-to-use-vault#create-a-secret)

## Local Run

### Using Docker

If dpp frontend is run using docker, the following environment variables must be set in [build and deploy script](../../../dpp-frontend/buildAndDeploy.sh):

- APP_VERSION
- APP_API_MAX_RETRIES
- API_SEARCH_TIMEOUT
- API_NEGOTIATE_TIMEOUT
- API_DECLINE_TIMEOUT
- APP_API_DELAY
- REPO_COMMIT_ID
- REPO_ENDPOINT_URL
- AUTH_ROLE_CHECK
- AUTH_BPN_CHECK
- AUTH_BPN_NUMBER
- APP_PORTAL_URL
- APP_ADMIN_EMAIL
- APP_AUTO_SIGN
- IDENTITY_PROVIDER_URL
- HOST_URL
- DATA_URL
- KEYCLOAK_CLIENTID
- KEYCLOAK_REALM
- KEYCLOAK_ONLOAD



```bash
# run script
../buildAndDeploy.sh consumer-ui
```
### Using Helm

The required variables must be set in values-*.yaml file manually.

Further info about vault plugin for helm charts: [argocd-vault-plugin-helm](https://catenax-ng.github.io/docs/guides/ArgoCD/howto-use-vault-secrets-with-argocd#argocd-vault-plugin-helm)


## Secrets Scanning

### Veracode
Veracode upload-and-scan is used for secret scanning and scan results are then published in veracode dashboard once job is completed [Static Application Serucity Testing](../infrastructure-as-code/IaC.md)

### Git Guardian

Git Guardian tool is used to scan secrets within application. It is currently active in the repository and managed by SEC team.

#### Pre-commit Hook:

A client side git hook that runs prior to commit code changes.

#### Pre-push Hook:

A client-side git hook similar to pre-commit hook that runs right before code changes are pushed to a remote origin.

GitGuardian hooks are performed through ggshield utility. ggshield is a wrapper around GitGuardian API for secrets detection that requires an API key to work. Please refer the official documentation for more information [here](https://docs.gitguardian.com/ggshield-docs/integrations/git-hooks/pre-commit)
