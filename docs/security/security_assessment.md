## Product Description

The Digital Product Passport App is Internet facing web app designed with a purpose of disclosing details about battery (and others products in the future) products for authenticated & authorized users.
Within the Catena-X Network, Product Passports are provided by manufacturers and can be exchanged in a standardized way. The data exchange standards are given by Catena-X and are used provide the product passport to different users in the network.
This passports can be used for different products like Batteries, Gearboxes, etc. At the moment the only product implemented are batteries, so the user interface only displays product passports. In the near future it will be able to display any passport structure, over a generic product passport that is in development at the moment.
The product passport consumer app provides an easy way to request a product passport from a manufacturer using the Catena-X network and standardized components and technologies. The passport will be displayed user-readable in an common browser. The app is used to access the passport data, which is provided by a manufacturer. Another interesting feature, is that you are able to scan a QR-code or by knowing the manufacturer and product-ID a user can request the passport over the Catena-X. On the other end, the manufacturer will provide passports with data elements, that the signed-in user is allowed to see the detailed information from a product.
This application is developed by the Product Passport Team, one of the members from Catena-X Circular Economy Team, aiming to contribute to the environmental cause, allowing recyclers, OEMs and dismantlers to know properties, dimensions and other important data related with a current product or material.
The product passport consumer app is an web-based application developed in Vue.js, making it accessible using standard browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc) for any user in the Catena-X Network.
It displays a specific passport for each product, in the Catena-X network hosted in a backend system. Using the Catena-X data exchange standards to request and receive data from the network it leverages the users and roles provided by Catena-X by using the required shared components (IAM, EDC, SSI, EDC Discovery, Discovery Finder and BPN Discovery) as well as the new Decentral DT-Registry.
The product passport consumer app UI follows the Catena-X CI layout, keeping things simple for the user while still providing the necessary information.

An User can request a passport:
* Either by scanning a QR-code which leads to the a passport view UI, allowing the user to visualize all the necessary/required information of a product. Making easier to dismantle it.
* In case a QR is not provided, the user is able to introduce the product id manually in a search field.  
As the data provider might not send every data field regarding to the users privileges, the application is flexible with its layout and data handling, displaying only what it receives.

## Security Control Design

Current state of the security controls already implemented within the application.

Authentication, authorization  - Product Passport App is using Catena - X Portal authentication & authorization mechanism, it's implemented according to CX policies & requirements, with the usage of CX Keycloak & secure way of populating the privileges with the usage of tokens. 
Session Management - Session timeout limit for users is set for 300 seconds. Session IDs are not transmitted in the URLs, concurrent session (one user logging on 2 different devices) is possible. 
File Upload / Download -Product Passport app do not have any features for file downloads or uploads.
Encryption - Product Passport application is using secure encryption channel for all data in transit with the usage of HTTPS & TLS. All interactions with other C-X applications require compliance with the C-X security standards. Passport application is not storing the processed data.


Authentication & Authorization Concept:

Passport App Authentication & Authorization concept is fully dependable on Catena - X Portal authentication. Only authenticated in C-X Portal Users may access the Passport Application.
Application authentication is populated with usage of token generated by CX Portal Keycloak. 
Passport Application currently have 4 users roles available for interested users. Authorization data is stored securely within Passport application secret storage.
Users without roles assignment are not authorized to access the application.

Additionally all of the users that authenticate within the Application have to be compliant with BPN Checks.
That means that all user's BPN number have integrity check in place comparing it with the BPN number associated to that users within EDC.


Please find roles description below :
OAM - allowing a set of details available only to the authorized personnel
Dismantler - allowing a set of details available only to the authorized personnel
Recycler - allowing a set of details available only to the authorized personnel
Public customer - allowing a set of details available to everyone with access to the product ID (The role is still under implementation)
