# Data Retrieval Script
A command line python script to request for any aspect model data using the Digital Product Passport (DPP) backend reusable component.

## Pre-requisites:
- The provider components setup:
    - Decentralized Digital Twin Registry (dDTR)
    - Backend data service (submodel server)
    - EDC setup
- The consumer components setup:
    - DPP backend service
    - EDC and IRS services setup
- Company is onboarded and credentials are issued from the portal
- Python version 3+ is installed in your Operating System

### Install Python-requests library

Prior to execute the script, the `python-requests` library must be installed:

```bash
# if python is used
apt-get install python-requests

# if python3 is used
apt-get install python3-requests
```

## Features
- Retrieve DPP information using the backend in json format and prints it to the standard output
-  Prints data retrieval status to console output on each step
- Perform authentication either from the centrally managed authorization server (keycloak) based on company and user credentials or from the access token provided by the user
- Export enabled/disabled option to export the requested aspect data to a json file
- Logging to log intermediate retrieval status to a file for further backtracking/debugging/troubleshooting
- The backend API and authorization server settings are configurable
- Capable to handle exception and error messages
- When doing contract negotiation by using this script the first contract is always used

## TL;DR 
- The default script configuration is provided in [Constants.py](./utilities/constants.py) and can be changed based on the authentication provider.
- Configure the username/password, appId and following required script parameters (shown in below table) in [get-data.sh](./get-data.sh)
- Execute the script `get-data.sh` in a terminal
```bash
./get-data.sh
```

The following parameters can be added in the [get-data.sh](./get-data.sh)
