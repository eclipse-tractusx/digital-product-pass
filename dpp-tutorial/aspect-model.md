# DPP Instance Aspect Model Creation Guide

This guide provides a simple explanation on how to create a digital product pass serialized aspect model payload.

## Prerequisites

You must fullfill the following pre-requisites:

- A Catena-X Standarized Aspect Model (in this case we use the [Digital Product Pass v2.0.0 Model](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sldt-semantic-models/tree/main/io.catenax.generic.digital_product_passport/2.0.0))
- JSON Editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/)
- Car Parts JSON Test Data [found here](./resources/test-data/carParts.json)

>[!WARNING]
>
> The model v2.0.0 of the Digital Product Pass is **DEPRECATED** and its used here only as demo purposes, please check the latests models in: [Digital Product Pass Models](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sldt-semantic-modelstree/main/io.catenax.generic.digital_product_passport)


## Aspect Model Creation

Follow this steps to create a new Digital Product Passport serialized model:

### 1ยบ - Find test data before generating the model

In the worksession you will receive a paper with the test data, you can find the same information [here](./resources/test-data/carParts.json) in a tes JSON file.

To find your part and be able to copy and paste the information:

1 - Search by uuid with CTRL + F:

![search id](./resources/screenshots/idsearch.png)

You will get your information in a paper:

Example:

```json
{
 "f10c0181-ce80-4139-81f0-a59226c88bfe": {
      "Name":"TRUNK LID HINGE (LEFT)",
      "PCF (Product Carbon Footprint)": "189 kgCO2e",
      "Height": "24 cm",
      "Width": "2 cm",
      "Length": "38 cm",
      "Weight": "1.4 kg",
      "id": "f10c0181-ce80-4139-81f0-a59226c88bfe",
      "Part Instance ID": "DLH-5159",
      "Manufacturing Date": "01.12.2023",
      "Placed on Market Date": "15.01.2024",
      "List of Materials": "Aluminum",
      "Hazard Materials": "Lead, Butyl, Cyanoacrylates, Polyurethane",
      "Guarantee": "24 months"
  }
}

```

> [!TIP]
> Copy and paste the data for creating your digital product pass faster!



### 2ยบ - Copy the digital product pass aspect model template into a new file or window

Paste this [Digital Product Passport v2.0.0 Payload](./resources/payloads/example.json) in the VS Code/Notepad++:

![DPP Example](./resources/screenshots/dpp-example.png)

It is a test data template that can be personalized to your part with the test data provider to you and your creativity!

### 3ยบ - Substitute data in the template

For example for adding the PCF value follow the following path:

```text
sustainability.PEF.carbon.value
```

Example:

![PCF](./resources/screenshots/pcf-update.png)

#### Where to substitute the data?

Follow this paths to find where the information is located.

| Property | Path |
| -------- | ----- |
| Name (Really short) | typology.shortName |
| Complete Name (More fancy name) | typology.longName |
| Class/Type of Part | typology.class.definition |
| PCF | sustainability.PEF.carbon.value |
|Height| characteristics.physicalDimension.height.value |
|Width| characteristics.physicalDimension.width.value|
|Length| characteristics.physicalDimension.length.value|
|Weight| characteristics.physicalDimension.grossWeight.value|
|Part Instance Id | identification.localIdentifier.value |
|Manufacturing Date |operation.manufacturer.manufacturingDate |
|List of Materials | sustainability.material.left.name.name (Add In Array)|
|Hazard Materials | critical.left (add elements to list) |
| Guarantee | lifespan (Add value and unit for garantee) |

Congratulations! You have successfully created your own digital product pass!

The next step will be to register your data in a Data Service, for that follow the [digital-twin-provision](./digital-twin-provision.md) guide.

> [!TIP]
> You can add more relavant data and personalized information at the digital product pass, follow the template and modify the data as you wish!
