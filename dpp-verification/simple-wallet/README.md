# What is the simple wallet?

This simple wallet application is an extention testing application for the Digital Product Pass Verification Add-On.

It provides a functional wallet able to:
  - Sign verifiable credentials with JsonWebSignature2020 proofs
  - Verify verifiable credentials with JsonWebSignature2020 proofs
  - Manage private and public keys, providing via DID Documents public keys in JsonWebKey2020 format

Additionally the simple wallet contains a extension for creating JSON-LD @contexts using Catena-X SAMM Models Schemas.
This allows the verifiable credentials to be valid JSON-LDs documents and enables the context of the existing and future modeled documents.

# Helm Charts

The helm charts are available at the following path:

[`../charts/simple-wallet`](../charts/simple-wallet)

It can be used to deploy the application.

The URL for hosting the wallet is configured here:

```yaml
ingress:
  enabled: true
  className: "nginx"
  annotations:
    ingressClassName: nginx
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/force-ssl-redirect: "true"
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-passthrough: "false"
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: "HTTP"
  hosts:
    - host: &hostname "<url-from-wallet>"
      paths:
        - path: /
          pathType: Prefix
  tls:
    - secretName: tls-secret
      hosts:
        - *hostname
```

## Credential Storage

The wallet configuration for storing credentials are in the following location:

```yaml
credentials:
  storage: 
    # -- Enables the storage of credentials
    enabled: true
```

If the storage is disabled the credentials will not be stored.
And in case it is enabled credentials will be stored in the following dynamic path:

`./credentials/<partner-bpn>/<issue-date>/<credentialUUID>.jsonld`

## Keys Creation

For every BPN configured in the wallet configuration a key will be created in the first request.

Three keys will be created in the following path `./keys/<partner-bpn>`:

- `key.jwt` -> The JWT key generated from the private key
- `private_key.pem` -> The private key from the partner
- `public_ket.pem` -> The public key in format pem

# Docker Local Deployment

To deploy the digital product pass simple wallet follow this steps:

Asure you are in the right folder:

```
cd dpp-verification/simple-wallet
```

## 1º- Image creation

```
docker build -t simple-wallet:v1 .
```

## 2º- Run container

```
docker run --rm -p 7777:7777 simple-wallet:v1
```

## 3º - Start sending requests

One it is deployed you will see this starting message:

## Health API

The health api is from type `public` and gives the status from the server health.

### Health API response

It retrieves the status and the timestamp of the status.

```json
{
    "status": "RUNNING",
    "timestamp": 1719576357.002888
}
```

## Context API

The context api will transfer the JSON Schema structure to a generic JSON-LD context schema.

### Context API Header

| Key | Description | Example | Mandatory |
| --- | ----  | ------- | :-----: |
| `BPN` | A valid Catena-X Bussiness Partner Number identifying the company owner of the keys and signing the credentials | `BPNL000000000012` | X |

The DPP allows for efficient information flows following best practices; and the possibility of accompanying the measures under this Regulation with mitigating measures so that impacts are expected to remain proportionate for SMEs.This is expected to increase transparency, both for supply chain businesses and for the general public, and increase efficiencies in terms of information transfer to support the data exchange between economic actors in integrating circularity in product design and manufacturing.\nIn particular, it is likely to help facilitate and streamline the monitoring and enforcement of the regulation carried out by EU and Member State authorities. It is also likely to provide a market-intelligence tool that may be used for revising and refining obligations in the future.\nThe DPP includes data about components, materials and chemical substances, information on reparability, spare parts, environmental impact and professional disposal for a product.\nThe data model will be updated, as newer versions of the regulation will be published.\nThe main basis is provided by the document \"Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL establishing a framework for setting ecodesign requirements for sustainable products and repealing Directive 2009/125/EC\" from March 30th, 2022. The latest version of the document was the provisional agreement between the EU Council and the Parliament from January 9th, 2024. The text is informal, but the content of the final regulation was agreed between these two institutions.\nThe Title of Ecodesign Regulation has been changed to: Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL establishing a framework for setting ecodesign requirements for sustainable products, amending Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 and repealing Directive 2009/125/EC.",

It is also likely to provide a market-intelligence tool that may be used for revising and refining obligations in the future.\nThe DPP includes data about components, materials and chemical substances, information on reparability, spare parts, environmental impact and professional disposal for a product.\nThe data model will be updated, as newer versions of the regulation will be published.\nThe main basis is provided by the document \"Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL establishing a framework for setting ecodesign requirements for sustainable products and repealing Directive 2009/125/EC\" from March 30th, 2022.

## Verify API

The verify api is required for checking and validating the proof contained in a verifiable credential againts its content. Using this concept we are able to verify the integrity of the data contained in the verifiable credential. It verifies only the following signatures:

- `JsonWebSignature2020`

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> The reason behind the usage of this signature type, is because it used in the Gaia-X standards and it is also used in the Eclipse Dataspace Connector communications with the SSI Wallet.

### Verify API Response

The response will indicate if the verifiable credential proof was verified againts the content or not!

#### Successfull Verification Response

If was successful, the key `verified` will be `true`.
A message will be displayed confirming the verifiable credential was verified correctly.

```json
{
    "message": "Verified Credential is Valid! The proof was verified!",
    "verified": true
}
```

#### Unsuccessfull Verification Response

If was not successful, the key `verified` will be `false`.
And the reason for the verification to be not valid will be displayed.

```json
{
    "message": "It was not possible to verify the signature!  REASON: [The credential is not verified! The signature was not able to be verified againts the data!]",
    "verified": false
}
```

## DID API

The `DID Api` is also a `public` api which retrieves the public key of the associated wallet partner selected in the parameters.
This api is necessary because for the a Verifiable Credential to be verifiable the public key from the wallet and partner that has signed it need to be publicly accessible. This method provides the following keys:

- `JsonWebKey2020` -> provided for `JsonWebSignature2020` signatures

### DID API Path Params

The path param for the DID Api is the `BPN` which must be specified before the sufix `did.json`.

It will give the public key from the BPN if it exists.

### DID API Response

The API response from the DID Api will be a valid JSON-LD Object that represents the DID object with the Key contained in the verifiable credential `verificationMethod` key.

This API will be called by another simple wallet or another wallet to find the standard public key interface for the signatures available.

# Authorization and Authentication Configuration

In the helm charts:

[`../charts/simple-wallet/values.yaml`](../charts/simple-wallet/values.yaml)

You will find the following configuration:

```yaml
security:
  # -- Enables the api key authorization
  enabled: true
  # -- BPN and their respecitve api key
  apiKeys:
      BPNL00000000W3BS: <apiKeyTest>
      BPNL00000000WAWT: <apiKeyTest2>
      BPNL00000000ASDH: <apiKeyTest3>
```

They keys in the API Keys can be configured dinamically matching the BPNs of the companies that are allowed to used the "Authenticated" APIs from the simple wallet. The api key value sent in the request headers **MUST** be with the same as the defined ones in the configuration for the specific BPNs.

## More information
